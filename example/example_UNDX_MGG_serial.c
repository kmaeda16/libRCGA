In this program, the below problem will be solved as an example.

--------------------- Example Problem ---------------------
Minimize:
    f(x) = x[1] * x[1] + x[2] * x[2] + ... + x[10] * x[10]
	
Subject to:
    g1(x) = x[1] * x[2] + 1 <= 0
	g2(x) = x[1] + x[2] + 1 <= 0
	-5.12 <= x[i] <= 5.12 for all i
-----------------------------------------------------------

This source code includes the below three functions.
1. main           : RCGA-related parameters are set, and RCGAInitial, RCGA, and RCGADeInitial are called in this order.
2. example        : Problem to be solved is defined.
3. example_decode : Lower and upper bounds of decision variables and how to convert genes to decision variables are defined.
To solve your own problem, you need to modify these three functions.

Compilation:
gcc example_UNDX_MGG_serial.c ../lib/libundxmgg_serial.a -I../include -o example_UNDX_MGG_serial_executable -lm

Execution:
./example_UNDX_MGG_serial_executable

By default, three output files are generated by the execution.
*_*_transition.dat : Best individual during the search. This file is produced every generation.
*_*_solution.dat   : Best individual during the search. This file is produced at the end of the search.
*_*_population.dat : Population at the final generation. This file is produced at the end of the search.
